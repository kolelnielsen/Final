    <h3>Classroom Attendance</h3>
    <p class="center-justified">In order to receive credit for attendance student's must attend 75 percent of all classes held each term. 
        Absences which lower a student’s attendance for a term below 75 percent for whatever reason must be made up in order to receive credit. 
        When a student has missed 20 perent of the class it is considered an absence. There are three types of absences in seminary:
        <ul id="center-justified">
            <li >School Excused: Absence for school activities that are verified by school administration.</li>
            <li>Parent excused: Absence for illness, doctor’s appointments, and family needs, etc. that are communicated by the 
                student’s parent or guardian.</li>
            <li>Unexcused: Absence that is not excused by the school or the student’s parent or guardian. Every unexcused absence 
                must be made up, or excused, before credit is awarded even if a student still meets the 75 percent attendance requirement. 
                Unexcused absences result in credit being withheld until the absences are made-up. Unexcused absences below the 75 percent
                attendance mark are required to be made up before credit is received.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<div class="ctr">
        <img src="/images/test.jpg" alt="icon of test with an A+" height="256" width="221" id="ctr">
        <h3>Test</h3>
        <p class="center-justified">In order to receive credit student's must pass a course learning assessment (I use the word 'test' so the acronym works) with a 
            score of 75 percent of higher. The assessment may be taken as many times as needed to pass.
            The assessment will be given once a year typically during the month of January.

            <img src="/images/reading.jpg" alt="icon of person reading" height="225" width="225" id="ctr">
            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p class="center-justified">In order to receive credit student's must complete the assigned course 
                readings. For example, this next year student's will need to read the first half of the New Testament 
                (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) as well as the first half of The Book of Mormon (1 Nephi 1 through Alma 16).

        <img src="/images/tardy.jpg" alt="old bell alarm clock" height="280" width="205" id="ctr">
        <h3>Tardiness</h3>
        <p class="center-justified">Tardies are given when student's show up to class after the bell has rung. 
        Tardiness is not equated with absences. Seminary credit may be withheld, however, for
        excessive tardiness. Student's lose credit on their 6th tardy. A makeup work assignment will be 
        given by the teacher to make up these tardies. Parents will be made aware of tardiness problems.
