    <h2 id="objective">What is Seminary?</h1>
    <p>Welcome to seminary! The seminary program of The Church of 
        Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a four-year religious
        education program for youth. The four Standard Works, the Old Testament,
        the New Testament, The Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants, 
        will be taught through your high school experience. This year we will 
        be covering the New Testament the first semester and the first half of
        The Book of Mormon for the second semester.</p>

    <h2 id="objective">The Objective of Seminary</h1>
        <p>Our purpose if to help youth understand and rely upon 
            the teachings and Atonement of Jesus Christ, 
            qualify for the blessings of the temple, and 
            prepare themselves, their families, and others 
            for eternal life with their Father in Heaven.</p>

                <p>"Seminary and institute will help you remodel your home to 
                    become a sanctuary of faith—a place where the gospel of 
                    Jesus Christ is taught, learned, lived, and loved. Wherever 
                    you live, that dwelling can become a place where true disciples 
                    of Jesus Christ reside. There you can seek refuge from the storms 
                    of life and increase your love of the Lord and for each other…. 
                    Graduating from seminary and institute will increase your ability 
                    to excel in the most important things you will ever do in life. 
                    True joy will be yours! I so testify, with my expression of love for 
                    each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen."

                    <p>"There are three powerful things seminary can do. First, it puts young 
                        people together who share the same values. Youth like to be with others 
                        who share their faith and who love the scriptures. Second, it puts youth 
                        together with a teacher who has a testimony, and they can feel the fire 
                        of it when it is borne. Third, seminary gets young people into the scriptures."

                        Listen to your teachers carefully. Apply what you learn prayerfully."

                    <p>"The holy scriptures, the guidance of your parents, and the diligent teaching you 
                        receive in Primary, Young Women, Sunday School, sacrament meeting, and seminary 
                        will fortify you in your determination to be your best self."</p>
